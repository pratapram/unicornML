# Module 2: Sentiment Analysis using Comprehend

In this module you'll use [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) to analyze the feedback that users enter through the web page. The browser application that you deployed in the first module allows users to enter their name and feedback. The JavaScript running in the browser invokes an API Gateway method, which executes a Lambda function to persist the information entered in a DynamoDB table.
 
In order to activate “Predict Sentiment” functionality, you will add another method in your API Gateway and a corresponding Lambda function. The Lambda function will invoke Amazon Comprehend Service API to predict the sentiment expressed in user's feedback.

If you're already comfortable with invoking SageMaker API from a Lambda function, or just want to skip ahead and start working with custom model training and hosting on SageMaker, you can launch one fo these AWS CloudFormation templates in the region of your choice to build out the sentiment prediction functionality automatically.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture for this module is composed of AWS Lambda function that leverage the sentiment analysis capabilities of Amazon Comprehend. Feedback entered by the user through the web page is persisted in a DynamoDB table. Upon the request from the web page, API Gateway invokes the Lambda function, which sends an API call to Comprehend to do the sentiment analysis. The result is saved to the DynamoDB table and the web page gets refreshed to show the result of the analysis, both through the Lambda function and API Gateway.

## Implementation Instructions

Each of the following sections provide an implementation overview and detailed, step-by-step instructions. The overview should provide enough context for you to complete the implementation if you're already familiar with the AWS Management Console or you want to explore the services yourself without following a walkthrough.

If you're using the latest version of the Chrome, Firefox, or Safari web browsers the step-by-step instructions won't be visible until you expand the section.

<<<<<<< HEAD
### 1. Create a Lambda Function 

#### Background

AWS Lambda will run your code in response to events in this case from API Gateway (which we will cover in the next section). In this step you'll build the core function that will process API requests (via API Gateway) from the web application to detect a sentiment of a feedback text. In the next section you'll use Amazon API Gateway to create a RESTful API that will expose an HTTP endpoint that can be invoked from your users' browsers. You'll then connect the Lambda function you create in this step to that API in order to create a fully functional backend for your web application.

#### High-Level Instructions

Use the AWS Lambda console to create a new Lambda function called `PredictFeedbackSentiment` that will process the requests. 

Make sure to configure your function to use the `VOCLambdaRoleComprehend` IAM role you created in the previous section.

## Implementation Validation

For this section you will test the function that you built using the AWS Lambda console. In the next section you will add a REST API with API Gateway so you can invoke your function from the browser-based application that you deployed in the first module.

1. From the main edit screen for your function, select **Configure test event** from the the **Select a test event...** dropdown.
    ![Configure test event](images/configure-test-event.png)
	
1. Keep **Create new test event** selected.

1. Enter `TestRequestEvent` in the **Event name** field

1. Copy and paste the following test event into the editor:

	```JSON
    {
        "path": "/ride",
        "httpMethod": "POST",
        "headers": {
            "Accept": "*/*",
            "Authorization": "eyJraWQiOiJLTzRVMWZs",
            "content-type": "application/json; charset=UTF-8"
        },
        "queryStringParameters": null,
        "pathParameters": null,
        "requestContext": {
            "authorizer": {
                "claims": {
                    "cognito:username": "the_username"
                }
            }
        },
        "body": "{\"PickupLocation\":{\"Latitude\":47.6174755835663,\"Longitude\":-122.28837066650185}}"
    }
    ```

    ![Configure test event](images/configure-test-event-2.png)
	
1. Click **Create**.

1. On the main function edit screen click **Test** with `TestRequestEvent` selected in the dropdown.   

1. Scroll to the top of the page and expand the **Details** section of the **Execution result** section.

1. Verify that the execution succeeded and that the function result looks like the following:

```JSON
{
    "statusCode": 201,
    "body": "{\"RideId\":\"SvLnijIAtg6inAFUBRT+Fg==\",\"Unicorn\":{\"Name\":\"Rocinante\",\"Color\":\"Yellow\",\"Gender\":\"Female\"},\"Eta\":\"30 seconds\"}",
    "headers": {
        "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*"
    }
}
```

After you have successfully tested your new function using the Lambda console, you can move on to the next section.

### 2. Add Policy to Lambda Execution Role 

#### Background

In Module 1,  you have created Lambda execution role `VOCLambdaRole`. In order for your Lambda function to call the Comprehend API, you will need to add policy to grands your Lambda function permission to detect sentiment. 

#### High-Level Instructions

Use the IAM Management Console to add a policy to an exisitng role. Go to the Lambda execution role you created in Module 1. You'll need to create a custom inline policy for your role that allows the `comprehend:DetectSentiment` action. 

<details>
<summary><strong>Step-by-step instructions (expand for details)</strong></summary><p>

1.	Go to the IAM Management Console, and look for the `VOCLambdaRole` role you created in the Module 1.

1.	Select the `VOCLambdaRole` role that you created in the Module 1.

1.	On the Permissions tab, choose the **Add inline policy** link in the lower right corner to create a new inline policy. 
	![Inline policies screenshot](images/inline-policies.png)

1. Select **Choose a service**.

1. Begin typing `Comprehend` into the search box labeled **Find a service** and select **Comprehend** when it appears. 
	![Select policy service](images/select-policy-service.png)
	
1. Choose **Select actions**.

1.	Begin typing `DetectSentiment` into the search box labeled **Filter actions** and check the box next to **DetectSentiment** when it appears.

1. Choose **Review Policy**.

1. Enter `ComprehendDetectSentiment` for the policy name and choose **Create policy**.

### 3. Add a Resource and Method to the existing REST API

API Gateway calls the Lambda function we created at the previous step. Create a GET method that invokes the Lambda function and passes the IDs of each user feedback as an event. 

Create a new resource called `/detectsentiment` within your API. Then create a GET method for that resource and configure it to use a Lambda proxy integration backed by the `DetectSentiment` function you created in the previous section.

<details>
