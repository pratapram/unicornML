# Module 2: Sentiment Analysis using Comprehend

In this module you'll use [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Amazon Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) to analyze the feedback that users enter through the web page. The browser application that you deployed in the first module allows users to enter their name and feedback. The JavaScript running in the browser invokes an API Gateway and then Lambda to persist the information entered in a DynamoDB table.
 
Now in order to activate “Predict Sentiment” functionality, you will implement an API Gateway and a Lambda function that 

## Architecture Overview

The architecture for this module is composed of AWS Lambda function that leverage the sentiment analysis capabilities of Amazon Comprehend. Feedback entered by the user through the web page is persisted in a DynamoDB table. Upon the request from the web page, API Gateway invokes the Lambda function, which sends an API call to Comprehend to do the sentiment analysis. The result is saved to the DynamoDB table and the web page gets refreshed to show the result of the analysis, both through the Lambda function and API Gateway.

## Implementation Instructions

Each of the following sections provide an implementation overview and detailed, step-by-step instructions. The overview should provide enough context for you to complete the implementation if you're already familiar with the AWS Management Console or you want to explore the services yourself without following a walkthrough.

If you're using the latest version of the Chrome, Firefox, or Safari web browsers the step-by-step instructions won't be visible until you expand the section.
